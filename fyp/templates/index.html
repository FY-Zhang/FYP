                                    According to UL regulations, international freshmen must pay a minimum of 50% of the tuition fee to receive a visa support letter. Because Chinese people must have a visa to enter Ireland, students need to pay 50% of the tuition fee in advance and apply for a visa after getting the visa support letter.

                                    If you plan to live in an on-campus accommodation, you need to make a reservation from the school’s <a href="https://studentliving.ul.ie/">accommodation website</a> before coming to Ireland. The accommodation application system will be opened in March every year. It is worth noting that, applications for new incoming first years are not on a first come first serve basis, so you have enough time to consider the apartment you really want to live in and submit the application before the due date of the application.

                                    When you are packing your luggage, do you think that you need to bring a lot of luggage to live in Ireland for a long time? In fact, it is not necessary.
                                </p>

                                    <b>Clothes.</b> When I went to Ireland, I took a whole suitcase of clothes, but in the end they only increased the weight of my luggage. Irish clothes are not more expensive than Chinese clothes, so I recommend bringing a small number of clothes and buying clothes locally when you need. Besides, Ireland is not very hot in summer, you can wear the same kind of clothes in spring, summer and autumn, so it is unnecessary to buy a lot of clothes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Kitchenware.</b> Campus accommodation provides almost all the kitchenwares you use, so there is no need to worry about that. <a href="https://www.argos.ie/">Argos</a> is a large general merchandise retailer, and there are three in Limerick, you can buy some kitchenware you need from there, such as the knife, rice cooker, etc. Of course, if you don’t want to go shopping in the city centre as soon as you arrive in Ireland, you can bring a kitchen knife and some pairs of chopsticks from China, because they are essential for cooking and eating, and not heavy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>Umbrella.</b> It is best to bring an umbrella when you come to Ireland. Compared to Shandong, Ireland rains more frequently, so you may always keep an umbrella in your bag. In addition, umbrellas in Ireland are much more expensive than in China, so it is better to bring an extra as a spare.

                                        <b><a href="https://www.spar.ie/">Spar</a>:</b> Spar is a Dutch supermarket. There are two Spar near the school, one on the campus and one at the main entrance at UL. The goods in Spar are few and expensive, so it suitable for buying some snacks and urgent items. For example, for a sandwich of the same weight, Spar sells for €2.99, while Lidl only sells for €1.99.

It is located in Limerick city centre, which is a large supermarket with many types of goods, but the price is a little more expensive than Lidl and ALDI.

It also provides delivery service, but it is more expensive than Tesco. For example, for almost identical muffins, Tesco has each of €0.95, while SuperValu has each of €2.5. In addition, I usually spent about €20 more to buy foods for a week in SuperValu than in Tesco.

                                    No matter which student village you live in, it is always easy to take the bus to the city centre, usually take 304 or 307 route. For convenience and to save money, you can apply for Leap Card at Student Life, then you do not need to prepare coins every time you take the bus. Because the city centre is only 5 kilometres away from the school, cycling or even walking are also good choices.

                                    UL campus is located in the northeast of Limerick, which is 5 kilometres far away from the city centre. The campus is built on both sides of River Shannon, with many trees and lawns. It is a scenic campus. There is no gates and walls in campus, so cars and buses can enter and exit at will, which is different with SDUT.
